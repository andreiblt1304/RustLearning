# minigrep

`minigrep` is a lightweight, command-line search tool written in Rust, inspired by the functionality of Unix's `grep`. It enables fast searching of text within files, harnessing the safety and performance of Rust.

## Features

- **Pattern Matching**: Search for patterns within a file using regular expressions.
- **Line Number Display**: Option to display line numbers alongside the search results.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Perform case-insensitive searches with an optional flag.
- **Context Control**: Set the number of lines before and after the match to display.
- **Environment Variable Support**: Configure default behavior through environment variables.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error reporting for a better user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed on your system.
- Git is required to clone the repository.

### Installation

1. Clone the `minigrep` repository:
